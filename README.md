- go is a statically typed language - once a type is inferred for a variable it cannot be changed
- go is a strictly typed language - we can only do strict rules on which operation can be done on different types

#### packages

- **packages** is  a folder of go files
- every go file belong to a packages
- within a packages all go files should have the same package name
- `main` packages tell the compiler that this packages is the executions starts

#### modules

-**modules** is the collection of these packages

- so when we are initializing a project we are initializing a module

```bash
go mod init githubPath/name
```
